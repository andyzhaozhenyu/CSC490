## Location of the dataset
https://osf.io/dv2ag/

## Reason
1. It is the largest publicly released VCE(video capsule endoscopy) dataset. 
2. Since the dataset already has all the images labelled and has been classified by diseases, we can save time on understanding the medical backgrounds of this project and label the images ourselves. Instead, we can dive into the machine learning algorithms and try our best to optimize the accuracy.
3. Since the dataset has a broad application field, itâ€™s possible to identify many different diseases. Therefore, we hope to utilize the dataset and apply our model to the real medical area to help more people.
4. As mentioned in paper 1, the unlabelled data is well suited for semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.
5. There are two papers on this dataset. Although the results for all classification experiments are quite different, we can try using both of their methods and choose the one that best suits our needs.
