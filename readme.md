**CSC490 report** 
**Group name:**TBA
**Team member names:**Han Xian Xu Huang, Yuliang Wang, Zhenyu Zhao
**Distribution of responsibilities in the group:** Understand the papersSetup two ML modelsBuild the training models and algorithmsLowering data processing time on high-resolution imagesApply our algorithms to actual medical images other than the datasetTest the accuracy of the training models and algorithmsCompare the results we get to the results mentioned in the papersImprove the accuracy of the machine learning algorithmLooking for methods to augment the machine learning algorithmsExplore the possibility of using generative models to abate the class imbalance as mentioned in the paper
**Name of the dataset:**The Kvsair-Capsule Dataset
**Paper references:** Smedsrud, P.H., Thambawita, V., Hicks, S.A. *et al.* *Kvasir-Capsule*, a video capsule endoscopy dataset. *Sci Data* 8, 142 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00920-z
Srivastava, A., Tomar, N. K., Bagci, U., & Jha, D. (2022). Video Capsule Endoscopy Classification using Focal Modulation Guided Convolutional Neural Network. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.08298
**Location of the dataset:**https://osf.io/dv2ag/
**Reason:**It is the largest publicly released VCE(video capsule endoscopy) dataset. Since the dataset already has all the images labelled and has been classified by diseases, we can save time on understanding the medical backgrounds of this project and label the images ourselves. Instead, we can dive into the machine learning algorithms and try our best to optimize the accuracy.Since the dataset has a broad application field, itâ€™s possible to identify many different diseases. Therefore, we hope to utilize the dataset and apply our model to the real medical field to help more people.There are two papers on this dataset. Although the results for all classification experiments are quite different, we can try using both of their methods and choose the one that best suits our needs.![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E3Mkm16zbcw7YFfJzHP2CEvS5NMC2Qfr4njQnTAO0PG0SFLK_K6lf6px1ThEbIZbvM3zURFm-Vsa2abiL7wTAvn_lN7wg9z5Al2BsnKHu5vOQOysnS_aC3uCj1TrfVJq3GQSjR5Vuusrq6drDWtxn1ymr3Hi3HTDI-U1D4qoUZFF_oeDydRuPGaPbA)(Results from paper 1)
